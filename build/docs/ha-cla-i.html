<P CLASS="western">6. <B>MISCELLANEOUS</B></P>
<P CLASS="western">6.1 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the _________
excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain
circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded
by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus,
exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this

<P CLASS="western">6.2  Miscellaneous Provisions. This Agreement sets
out the entire agreement between You and Us for your Contributions to

may assign the rights and obligations under the Agreement to any
third party if the third party agrees, as a condition of the
assignment,  in writing to abide by the rights and obligations in the
Agreement. The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall
not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any
time in the future and a waiver of performance under a provision in
one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of
the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its
entirety. If any provision of this Agreement is found void and
unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible
with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of
essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the
maximum extent possible under law.</P>
