Entity. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot;

such entity.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">        &quot;Contribution&quot; means
any work of authorship that is Submitted by You to Us in which You
own or assert ownership of the Copyright. If You do not own the
Copyright in the entire work of authorship, please follow the

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">        &quot;Copyright&quot; means all
rights protecting works of authorship owned or controlled by You or

extensions by You.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">        &quot;Material&quot; means the
work of authorship which is made available by Us to third parties.
When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the

Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may be included in
the Material.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">        &quot;Submit&quot;  means any
form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or
our representatives, including but not limited to electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the purpose of discussing and
improving the Material, but excluding communication that is
conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as
&quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">        &quot;Submission Date&quot;

License</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(a) You retain ownership of the
Copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or
license the Contribution which You would have had without entering
into the Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(b) To the maximum extent permitted by
the relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under
the Copyright covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense
such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce,
modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution as part of
the Material; provided that this license is conditioned upon
compliance with Section 2.3.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">2.2 Patent License</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers
of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution
in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination);
provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with
Section 2.3. This patent license includes, without limitation,
method, process, and apparatus claims which You or Your Affiliates
own, control or have the right to grant, now or in the future, but
only to the extent to which making, having made, using, selling,
offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring the
Contribution, or the Contribution in combination with the Material as
it exists on the Submission Date, infringes such patent claims.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">2.3 Outbound
License</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Option One) As a condition on the
grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, We agree to license the
Contribution only under the terms of the license or licenses which We
are using on the Submission Date for the Material (including any

additional licenses [LIST_OF_LICENSES] (including any right to adopt
any future version of a license if permitted).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Option Three) As a condition on the
grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, We agree to license the
Contribution only under the terms of the license or licenses which We
are using on the Submission Date for the Material or any licenses
which are approved by the Open Source Initiative on or after the
Effective Date, including both permissive and copyleft licenses,
whether or not such licenses are subsequently disapproved (including
any right to adopt any future version of a license if permitted).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Option Four) As a condition on the

which are recommended by the Free Software Foundation for use in GNU
projects on or after the Effective Date, whether or not such licenses
are subsequently disapproved (including any right to adopt any future
version of a license if permitted).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(Option Five) Based on the grant of
rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include Your Contribution in a
Material, We may license the Contribution under any license,
including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses.
As a condition on the exercise of this right, We agree to also
license the Contribution under the terms of the license or licenses
which We are using for the Material on the Submission Date.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, We may use the following

successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or
indirect.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2.5 Our Rights. You acknowledge that We
are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material
and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2.6 Reservation of Rights. Any rights
not expressly licensed under this section are expressly reserved by
You.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>3. Agreement</B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You confirm that:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(a) You have the legal authority to
enter into this Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(b) You or Your Affiliates own the
Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are
required to grant the rights under Section 2.  
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(c) The grant of rights under Section 2
does not violate any grant of rights which You or Your Affiliates
have made to third parties.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(d) You have followed the instructions
in [NONOWNER_INSTRUCTIONS], if You do not own the Copyright in the
entire work of authorship Submitted.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>4. Disclaimer</B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN
SECTION 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;. MORE
PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY
YOU TO US. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE
DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM
PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>5. Consequential Damage Waiver</B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF
PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY
(CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>6. Miscellaneous</B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">6.1 This Agreement will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of [JURISDICTION] excluding
its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the
governing law in this section might be superseded by the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
(&quot;UN Convention&quot;) and the parties intend to avoid the
application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude
the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this
Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">6.2 This Agreement sets out the entire
agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and
overrides all other agreements or understandings.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">6.3  If You or We assign the rights or
obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, as a
condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing
to abide by all the rights and obligations in the Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">6.4 The failure of either party to
require performance by the other party of any provision of this
Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to
require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of
performance under a provision in one situation shall not be
considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future
or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">6.5 If any provision of this Agreement
is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to
the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the
meaning of the original provision and which is enforceable.  The
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply
notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or
any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.</P>
