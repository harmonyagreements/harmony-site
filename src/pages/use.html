      <h1>How to Use the Contributor Agreements</h1>
      <p>The Template Agreements are meant to be a toolkit for FOSS projects, and the terms of use of the Template Agreements are set forth in Section V.  In order to use the unmodified Template Agreement, a FOSS project must make the following choices:</p>
      <ol>
          <li><span>Select the appropriate set of Template Agreements: Project Harmony CA (Assignment) or Project Harmony CA (License). You will then have two agreements, one each for individuals and for corporations.</span></li>
          <li><span>If the Project Entity wishes to expand the “outbound license” beyond the license or licenses being used by the Project Entity on the Submission Date, then it must choose among the five options in Section 2.1. Once the Project Entity has selected an option, it should delete all of the other options to avoid confusion.</span></li>
          <li><span>If the Project Entity wishes to expand the licenses for Media beyond the license or licenses approved for "outbound licenses" in Section 2.1, the Project Entity should add these licenses in Section 2.1(e) in the Harmony Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and Section 2.1(g) in the Harmony Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA). They are most likely to be Creative Common licenses which are well suited for the type of works in the Media.</span></li>
          <li><span>Select the method of dealing with works whose copyrights are owned by third parties in Contributions and include a link in Section 3(d).</span></li>
          <li><span>Select the governing law and include in Section 5.1.</span></li>
          <li><span>Determine how to indicate agreement. Some options are:</span></li>
          <ol>
              <li type="a"><span>Signed agreements which are faxed or sent by PDF to the Project;</span></li>
              <li type="a"><span>Use of "digital signature" services such as www.docusign.com; or</span></li>
              <li type="a"><span>Use of email confirmations.</span></li>
          </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>These choices should be made after obtaining advice from counsel familiar with these issues.</p>
