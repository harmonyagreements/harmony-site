      <h2 id="email">Mailing Lists</h2>
      <p>The mailing list for Project Harmony is <a href="mailto:harmony-review@lists.harmonyagreements.org">harmony-review@lists.harmonyagreements.org</a>. All comments, suggestions, corrections, and discussions are welcome on this list. If you'd like to fully participate in the conversation, you can subscribe to the list at:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><span><a href="http://lists.harmonyagreements.org/mailman/listinfo/harmony-review">http://lists.harmonyagreements.org/mailman/listinfo/harmony-review</a>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(There is also an older mailing list for drafting work, which unfortunately has no subscribe interface. We'll be migrating this over to the new system soon, but in the meantime ping us on IRC if you'd like to subscribe.)</em></p>
      <h2 id="irc">IRC Channel</h2>
      <p>You can also find us on the Freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net) at the <strong><a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=harmonyagreements">#harmonyagreements</a></strong> channel. A few of us tend to be on the channel all the time, so it's a good place to go for immediate answers or conversation.</p>
      <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
      <p>The Harmony contributor agreements are currently in a public review phase (Alpha version), through May 6th, 2011. General discussion will happen on the <a href="http://lists.harmonyagreements.org/mailman/listinfo/harmony-review">harmony-review</a> mailing list.</p>
      <p>In addition, we also have a special format that automatically extracts comments from the mailing list into the <a href="comments.html">comment review page</a>. To mark off a comment in your email message, just put <strong>====</strong> before and after each comment, and note the line numbers. For example, this comment in an email message:</p>
      <pre>====
lines 6-8

This is an example comment.
====
</pre>
      <p>would display as a comment next to line 6 in the <a href="comments.html">comment review page</a>. Please take the line numbers for your comments from that page, and not from the PDF or ODF documents.</p>
