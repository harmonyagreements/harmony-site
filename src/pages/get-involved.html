      <h2 id="irc">IRC Channel</h2>
      <p>You can also find us on the Freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net) at the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/harmonyagreements">#harmonyagreements</a> channel (also available as a <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=harmonyagreements">webchat</a>). A few of us tend to be on the channel all the time, so it's a good place to go for immediate answers or conversation.</p>
      <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
      <p>The Alpha review phase of the Harmony contributor agreements is now closed. We are currently integrating all comments into new drafts for the next meeting of the Harmony drafting group on May 18th, 2011. Please continue to contribute all comments, suggestions, corrections, and discussions on the <a href="mailto:harmony-review@lists.harmonyagreements.org">harmony-review</a> mailing list.</p>
      <p>In addition to general discussion, the mailing list traffic also feeds into the <a href="comments.html">comment review page</a>. We use a special format to automatically extract comments from the mailing list messages. To mark off a comment in your email message, just put <strong>====</strong> before and after each comment, and note the line numbers. For example, this comment in an email message:</p>
      <pre>====
lines 6-8

This is an example comment.
====
</pre>
      <p>would display as a comment next to line 6 in the <a href="comments.html">comment review page</a>. Please take the line numbers for your comments from that page, and not from the PDF or ODF documents.</p>
