      <h1>How to Get Involved</h1>
      <h2 id="email">Mailing Lists</h2>
      <p>The mailing list for Project Harmony is <a href="mailto:harmony-review@lists.harmonyagreements.org">harmony-review@lists.harmonyagreements.org</a>. Anyone can post as a guest. If you'd like to fully participate in the conversation, subscribe to the list at:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><span><a href="http://lists.harmonyagreements.org/mailman/listinfo/harmony-review">http://lists.harmonyagreements.org/mailman/listinfo/harmony-review</a>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(There is also an older "temporary" mailing list for drafting work, which unfortunately has no subscribe interface. We'll be migrating this over to the new system soon, but in the meantime ping us on IRC if you'd like to subscribe.)</em></p>
      <h2 id="irc">IRC Channel</h2>
      <p>You can also find us on the Freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net) at the <strong><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/harmonyagreements">#harmonyagreements</a></strong> channel (also available as a <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=harmonyagreements">webchat</a>). A few of us tend to be on the channel all the time, so it's a good place to go for immediate answers or conversation.</p>
      <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
      <p>The Harmony contributor agreements are currently in a public review phase (Alpha version), through May 6th, 2011. All comments, suggestions, corrections, and discussions are welcome on the <a href="mailto:harmony-review@lists.harmonyagreements.org">harmony-review</a> mailing list.</p>
      <p>In addition to general discussion, the mailing list traffic also feeds into the <a href="comments.html">comment review page</a>. We use a special format to automatically extract comments from the mailing list messages. To mark off a comment in your email message, just put <strong>====</strong> before and after each comment, and note the line numbers. For example, this comment in an email message:</p>
      <pre>====
lines 6-8

This is an example comment.
====
</pre>
      <p>would display as a comment next to line 6 in the <a href="comments.html">comment review page</a>. Please take the line numbers for your comments from that page, and not from the PDF or ODF documents.</p>
